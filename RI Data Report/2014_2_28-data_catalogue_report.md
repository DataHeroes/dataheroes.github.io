Data Report

A brief compilation of data sets available on state agency and other websites

as of February 2014

Compiled by RI Statewide Planning Program

*Introduction*

The RI Division of Planning is a 2011 recipient of a Sustainable Communities Regional Planning Grant from HUD. One of the issues the Division would like to tackle through this grant and beyond is getting a handle on all the data resources currently available in the state: where they live, how they are maintained, how they are accessed, used, and analyzed, and how they are shared with others. Ultimately, we would love to see a central clearinghouse for statewide data (or a clear data network “map”) through which we could share our resources among our offices, and with the municipalities and the general public. Over time as specific data sharing needs arise, we hope to start formalizing relationships with other state agencies and organizations, building on the cooperative work and agreements that have already been shared in the state. In the meantime, we are looking for ways to build relationships among data professionals throughout the state, to encourage more and better networking and collaboration.
